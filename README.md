<strong>Goal</strong>

In this assignment, you will be implementing a text adventure game. You will be working with a number of classes, many of which will be subclasses of existing classes, or implementations of interfaces provided for you in the library.

<strong>Background</strong>

Computer-based adventure games have been around for a long time, dating back to the seminal works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colossal Cave AdventureLinks to an external site.</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">ZorkLinks to an external site.</a>, both in the 1970‚Äôs. If you‚Äôre interested in more information, see pages by <a href="http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/">Rick AdamsLinks to an external site.</a> or <a href="http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/canon/Adventure.htm">DG JerzLinks to an external site.</a> for tons of information and trivia about the Colossal Cave Adventure.

This assignment offers you lots of creative freedom, so please feel free to have fun with it!

<strong>Locked Out Scenario</strong>

The game starts off with you outside in your driveway at night, and the goal of this scenario is to get into your house. The front door to your house is locked, and you don‚Äôt have your key. You can go north to your garage, but the side door to your house (in the garage) is also locked.

&nbsp;

Here are the 8 items of this scenario, sorted by their initial locations:

<ul>
<li>front yard items:
<ul>
<li>front-door</li>
<li>wall-lantern (container)</li>
<li>fake-rock (container)
<ul>
<li>spare-key</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>garage items:
<ul>
<li>side-door</li>
<li>screw-driver</li>
<li>shoe-box (container)
<ul>
<li>light-bulb</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The pink circle in the front yard is a fake-rock, which is actually a closed container hiding your spare-key. The spare-key is not accessible until you open the fake-rock. However, the wall-lantern has no light-bulb, so it‚Äôs dark here, and you can‚Äôt open anything in the dark. Therefore you must fix the wall-lantern by using a new light-bulb.

To do this, you must first open the wall-lantern, by using a screw-driver. The screw-driver is in the garage, and so is a new light-bulb. However, the light-bulb is inside the shoe-box, which is closed. So you must open the shoe-box before you can take the light-bulb.

Once you‚Äôve fixed the wall-lantern, you can retrieve the spare-key from the fake-rock. You can then use the spare-key to unlock the front-door and/or the side-door. Either way will let you finally enter your house, and thus solve this scenario.

Note: Please don‚Äôt include any additional items in these three outside rooms (front yard, driveway, or garage) as they may interfere with the automated testing.

Note: The item names must all be exactly as they appear above. The hyphens are necessary because the parser only allows the player to enter two words per command, each word separated by a space. The first word is a command, and the second word is interpreted (or ignored) by the command processor.

Note: Doors only reside within a single room, and operate only in one direction. The font-door is in the font yard, and the side-door is in the garage, as shown in the diagram above. When locked, these doors inhibit movement into the house. However, they‚Äôre not considered at all when moving from inside the house to the front yard or to the garage.

<strong>Implementation</strong>

Your game class must be called <strong>MyGame</strong> and your test class must be called <strong>MyGameTest</strong>. You will need to develop these and several other classes, all in the <strong>edu.vt.cs5044</strong> package, to add the required features in your game. Your game implementation must do the following:

<ul>
<li>Your game must work according to the requirements described in the section ‚ÄúLocked Out Scenario‚Äù above. The maximum human-review score, if you complete this entire scenario ‚Äî and nothing more ‚Äî is 40/50. Assuming your automated score is 50/50, then the maximum total points would be 90/100 (or 90%). The final 10 available points are noted in blue below.</li>
<li>In addition to the 4 rooms above, you must develop and integrate at least <strong>3 additional</strong> rooms (1 point each). These additional rooms should be located outside of the house.</li>
<li>In addition to the 8 objects above, you must develop and integrate at least <strong>3 additional</strong> objects (1 point each).</li>
<li>The player must be able to win. There must be some situation that is recognized as the achieving the final goal of the game (1 point).</li>
<li>Your game must support the following commands:
<ul>
<li>examine (also shortcut x) ‚Äì Allows you to see the description of an item. This command should work as long as the item is in scope. An item is in scope if it is in the same room as you, or it is in your inventory.</li>
<li>take ‚Äì Allows you to take an item from the room and place it in your inventory.</li>
<li>inventory (also shortcut i) ‚Äì Allows you to view the list of items in your inventory.</li>
<li>open ‚Äì Allows you to open a closed container. If any object was contained in the container, that object is removed from the container and placed in the current room.</li>
<li>use ‚Äì Allows you to use an object in your inventory, to perform some action in the current room.</li>
<li>go ‚Äì Allows you to move around. Please note that your game must support <strong>three variants</strong> for each of the four movement directions (‚Äúnorth‚Äù, ‚Äúsouth‚Äù, ‚Äúeast‚Äù, and ‚Äúwest‚Äù). In addition to the ‚Äúgo [direction]‚Äù variant, your game must also support both one-word and one-letter abbreviations (1 point). For example, both ‚Äúnorth‚Äù and ‚Äún‚Äù must be equivalent to ‚Äúgo north‚Äù as ways to move in the ‚Äúnorth‚Äù direction. Note that you must support all of these variants with a single command class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition to the 6 commands above, you must develop and integrate at least <strong>2 additional</strong> commands (1 point each).</li>
</ul>
To make it easier to test your own game, and to ensure compatibility with the Web-CAT automated tests, please be sure to always use the Message class anywhere it applies. Don‚Äôt hard-code any message-related strings into your implementation, except in a custom Message subclass.

<strong>Submit to Web-CAT</strong>

Submit your solution to <a href="https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/">Web-CAT</a> via the Eclipse plug-in. Please feel free to improve and resubmit your code as many times as you like (before the deadline) in order to improve your score. See the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/156224/pages/project-grading-rubric">project grading rubric</a> for full details on the grading criteria.
